I'm an Applied Natural Language Processing Research Assistant at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. I primarily work on Domain Adaptation and Information Extraction using Large Language Models (LLMs) and more-traditional Transformers-based methods for Clinical use cases. In the past, I've worked on Language Generation and Conversational AI.

Prior to this, I was awarded my Masters in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts - Amherst where I focused on Machine Learning and NLP. I performed NLP Research at Prof. Andrew McCallum's IESL Lab (now under UMass NLP) where I worked on multi-lingual parsing and continual learning. I worked as a Systems Analyst at Visa after completing my Bachelor's in Information Systems and Advanced Analytics from Singapore Management University. Prior to pivoting to ML and NLP, I used to work on data-driven Program Management and Business Process Improvement for technology companies.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
